# DesktopApp Security Guide

Security features and considerations for DesktopApp.

## Security Status: Basic Protection

**Current Level:** Prototype security for local development  
**Risk Level:** Low (local-only application, no network features)

## Current Security Features

### Implemented
- **Local Storage:** All data stays on your computer
- **Demo Authentication:** Basic password hashing for test accounts
- **Session Management:** Secure session tokens instead of password storage
- **File Permissions:** Standard OS file protection
- **No Network Risk:** No cloud sync or remote data transmission

### Planned (Not Yet Implemented)
- Message encryption for data at rest
- Secure file attachment handling
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- OAuth integration with external services
- Advanced password requirements

## Data Storage

### Local Files
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\DesktopApp Project\DesktopApp\`  
**macOS:** `~/Library/Preferences/DesktopApp Project/DesktopApp/`  
**Linux:** `~/.config/DesktopApp Project/DesktopApp/`

### What's Stored
- Application settings and preferences
- Demo account session tokens
- Theme and UI preferences
- No sensitive user data or messages (in prototype)

### Future Storage Security
- Message encryption for sensitive conversations
- Secure file vault for attachments
- Optional master password for extra protection
- Automatic data cleanup options

## Privacy

### Data Collection
- **None:** No analytics, telemetry, or usage tracking
- **Local Only:** All data remains on your device
- **No Network:** No data transmitted to external servers

### Future Privacy Features
- Optional message encryption
- Local-only AI processing options
- Data export and deletion tools
- Privacy-focused AI provider options

## Network Security

### Current Status
- No network communication in prototype
- No external API calls
- Local-only operation

### Future Network Features
- TLS encryption for all external communication
- Certificate pinning for AI provider APIs
- Secure credential storage for API keys
- Request signing and validation

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep your system updated with latest security patches
- Use strong passwords when real authentication is implemented
- Review file permissions in data directories
- Be aware this is a prototype with limited security features

### For Developers
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use Qt's secure storage mechanisms
- Plan for security from the beginning

## Current Limitations

### Prototype Security
- Basic authentication only suitable for demos
- No encryption of stored data
- Limited input validation
- No audit logging
- Simplified session management

### Not Suitable For
- Production use with sensitive data
- Multi-user environments
- Network-accessible deployments
- Processing confidential information

## Future Security Roadmap

### Version 0.2
- Secure API key storage
- Basic message encryption
- Enhanced input validation
- Audit logging

### Version 0.3+
- Two-factor authentication
- Advanced encryption options
- Security audit and penetration testing
- Compliance with security standards

## Reporting Security Issues

This is a prototype project. For security concerns:
1. Check if the issue affects the current local-only scope
2. Consider the planned network features in your assessment
3. Report issues through standard project channels
4. Include impact assessment and suggested mitigations

## Disclaimer

DesktopApp is currently a prototype application focused on local development and testing. Security features are basic and suitable only for non-production use. Do not use for sensitive or confidential communications.

## Compliance & Standards

### Standards Compliance
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Framework**: Cybersecurity best practices
- **GDPR Principles**: Privacy by design and default

### Security Certifications
- **Common Criteria**: Security evaluation criteria
- **FIPS 140-2**: Cryptographic module validation
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls

## Conclusion

Security is an ongoing process that requires constant vigilance and improvement. This guide provides the foundation for maintaining security throughout the development and deployment lifecycle of DesktopApp.
